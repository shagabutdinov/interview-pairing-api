"Made with organic vegetables, black beans and tomatoes. No GMOs - genetically engineered ingredients. Gluten free. Microwave or regular oven. Family owned since 1988. This casserole is based on a popular Mexican dish called Chilaquiles. When Amy's parents first tasted it in Oaxaca they came back and asked Amy's chefs to find the recipe. One of the chefs (whose family had owned a Mexican restaurant in San Francisco) was already familiar with the dish and adapted it to suit Amy's standards - fewer hot spices and less fat. The result is delicious and might remind you of a bowl of nachos made with corn chips and melted cheddar and jack cheeses. Plus - an assortment of organic vegetables and our homemade fresh tofu. On the side are delicately seasoned slow-cooked black beans, making this gluten free meal in a bowl thoroughly satisfying. 0 g trans fat. No added MSG. No preservatives.

"Made with organic rolled oats. Nutrition for sustained energy. Clif Bar is named after my father, Clifford, my childhood hero and companion throughout the Sierra Nevada mountains. In 1990, I lived in a garage with my dog, skis, climbing gear, bicycle, and two trumpets. The inspiration to create an energy bar occurred during a daylong. 175-mile ride with my buddy Jay. We'd been gnawing on some other energy bars. Suddenly, despite my hunger, I couldn't take another bite. That's the moment I now call the epiphany. Two years later, after countless hours in Mom's kitchen, Clif Bar became a reality. And the mission to create a better-tasting energy bar was accomplished. Clif Bar has grown since then, and still the spirit of adventure that began on that ride continues to thrive each day.

Her family survived Prohibition by selling these grapes to home wine makers back East.

After the war, my uncles new advertising slogan, make friends with Franzia, introduced a new generation to wine. Our revolutionary fresh to the last glass Winetap system made its debut in 1978. Because it was more convenient and offered better value than bottles, Franzia started to catch on. It went on to become the world's most popular wine and the first (and only) Winetap to freshness date every package.

"The world's most popular wine. Drip-free smart tap. Since 1906. Premium wine. Table wine with natural flavors. A new beginning - Teresa Franzia, my grandmother, planted her first vineyard along the road to Yosemite in 1906. Her family survived Prohibition by selling these grapes to home winemakers back East. When Prohibition ended, my father and his six brothers and sisters rebuilt the winery brick by brick, barrel by barrel - everyone pitched in. After the war, my uncle's new advertising slogan, Make Friends with Franzia, introduced a new generation to wine. Our revolutionary Fresh to the Last Glass Winetap system made its debut in 1978. Because it was more convenient and offered better value than bottles, Franzia started to catch on. It went on to become the world's most popular wine and the first (and only) Winetap to freshness date every package. As we enter our second century of winemaking, we strive to uphold Teresa's legacy of quality, freshness and value.

"The earth friendly winery. Pioneers of sustainability. Established 1968. 14% less carbon emissions. Solar powered. Patience. Cabernet Sauvignon grapes hang on the trellis long after harvest beings each fall. Patience becomes a duty, not a virtue, as we wait for the grapes to ripen. Cabernet Sauvignon reminds me to slow down and wait for nature to unlock her secrets. So I relax and enjoy this wine full of black cherry flavors, a hint of chocolate and aromas of vanilla and spice and match with chops and steaks. Patience is truly rewarded.
